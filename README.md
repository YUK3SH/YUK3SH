<h2 align="center">Hi, this is Yukeshwar R</h2>

<p align="center">
  Engineering student working at the intersection of  
  <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>software development</b>, and <b>data-driven systems</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>I enjoy building systems where models, data, and code come together —  
  not just isolated experiments.</i>
